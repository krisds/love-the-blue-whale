Gather up the Löve, and share it with your sweetheart. But make sure to keep some heart yourself, if you wish to survive.

Made for [LÖVE Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/love2d-jam-2020), using Löve 11.3.

The theme, "Frequency", inspired the idea of literal waves. Ocean waves. Seeing the blue whale on the Jam page helped decide the main character. My kids then came up with Pinky to add some purpose and story. And so we end up with what one might tentatively call a game.

Everything was made during the Jam, except for:

* the sounds, which come from [Orange Free Sounds](http://www.orangefreesounds.com/) and [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/), and
* the font: Copyright (c) 2009-2015, Philippe Cochy with Reserved Font Name [Pecita](https://www.dafont.com/pecita.font).
